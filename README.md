movie_api

This is the backend api for my myFlix-client and myFlix-Angular-Client apps.  This api allows a user to store information about the users and movies in the apps it is for.

It will present information about the users, movies, directors, and genres.

This api uses MongoDB, Javascript, Node.js, Express, Mongoose, and Heroku to function.
